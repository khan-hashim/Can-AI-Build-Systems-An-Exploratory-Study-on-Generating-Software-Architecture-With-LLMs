# Can-AI-Build-Systems-An-Exploratory-Study-on-Generating-Software-Architecture-With-LLMs


This repository contains the chats for our work "Can AI Build-Systems An Exploratory Study on Generating Software Architecture With LLMs"

There are two main parts to this repository:

Single-Pass-Generation - contains results for all the both systems for single pass architecture generation for all prompt and model combinations including the generated architectures and the result csv files.

Two-Pass-Iterative Refinement - contains results for all the both systems for two-pass iterative architecture generation for all prompt and model combinations including the generated architectures and the result csv files.

Evaluation - Contains the code to generate the results shown in the study. All the generated files in single pass and two folder can be used to regenrate the evaluation data.
